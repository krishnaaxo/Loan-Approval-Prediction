# Loan or not loan app
Webapp using heroku to deploy ml model

## Content

A loan application is used by borrowers to apply for a loan. Through the loan application, borrowers reveal key details about their finances to the lender. The loan application is crucial to determining whether the lender will grant the request for funds or credit.

## Problem Statement

The director of SZE bank identified that going through the loan applications to filter the people who can be granted loans or need to be rejected is a tedious and time-consuming process. He wants to automate it and increase his bank’s efficiency. After talking around a bit, your name pops up as one of the few data scientists who can make this possible within a limited time. Will you help the director out? 

## Objective

The idea behind this ML project is to build an ML model and web application that the bank can use to classify if a user can be granted a loan or not.

After you’re done building the model, you can start creating a Web Application for the purpose of filtering loan applications.

The features that you have used for building the ML model will be the form inputs that will be taken from the bank official. You need to display “Approved” or “Rejected” on the basis of whether the application was approved or not.

Deploy the application on Heroku.
